# Vulnerability_Test_Project
Pulls pip information and OS installed packages and check if the installed version has a registered CVE. 

The tool knows how to find relevant CVE for a program and remove rejected CVEs.

Running time: it took me around 5 minutes for 108 python-pip packages. The bootle-neck is the online Circl API (More about the API later on).

# Motivation
NPM has integrated the [audit tool](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit) into the program.
This tool can show the number of vulnerable packages you are using in your project and help you to update the packages to a newer-secured version. (without breaking the dependencies) I thought it will be interesting to know how vulnerable my current python-pip packages. In contrast to npm, the packages are installed globally and therefore more vulnerable from a couple of projects (unless you use conda environments)

Later I extend the tool to support searching CVEs for Windows programs and ubuntu programs.

# How to run
full inspect OS + PIP - `python3 app.py`

pip: `python3 app.py -p`

OS : `python3 app.py -o`

File : `python3 app.py -f .\example.txt`

File format package==version separated with new line (see example.txt)

Review just pip inspection in the following Jupyter notebook (in the attached output, you can see it caught 3 CVEs for my pip in Windows 10 PC)

I ran the script on windows10 (windows10.txt) and ubuntu (ubuntu.txt) - overall it performed better on ubuntu than Windows because of the apt-get package manager which order all my installs with easy and clean naming schema.

# Implementation
The implementation is based on getting a program version through existed CLI.
To get python-pip packages' versions I used `pip freeze`.
The naming and the format are clean and good to use.
After parsing the output, the program search for each pip package in his CVES.
I used https://cve.mitre.org for listing the CVE and https://cve.circl.lu/api/ for detailed JSON on each CVE.

example Mitre API `curl https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=ycrypto`

example Circl API `curl https://cve.circl.lu/api/cve/CVE-2018-6594`

The JSON contained a field that can help to determine if the CVE is related.
I based on it to filter the relevant CVES.

`"vulnerable_product": ["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:skype:8.35:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"]`

Overral it was fun project and it did found 3 CVEs for pip packages on my Windows 10 PC (view notebook `safe_versions.ipynb`).

On my ubuntu WSL it found 6 apt-packages' CVEs and 8 pip packages' CVEs (view file `ubuntu.txt`).

# Extensions
I thought to add a support to get the OS installed programs' name and version.
I added support to get Linux (tested on Ubuntu18) installed packages 

`~$ dpkg -l`
<br/><br/>
In addition, I added support to get windows (tested on Windows10) installed programs
To get installed programs 

`PS ~ Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\*`

To get more installed programs 

`PS ~ Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\*`

To get Nicrosoft Store programs

`PS ~ Get-AppxPackage`

**!!!**  Yet this is not full list of installed program on my Windows 10  **!!!** for example I did not find [Zoom](zoom.us) installation with this API.

For each one, I piped the input through fields filter and table format preinstalled programs of PowerShell.
for example :

`PS ~ Get-AppxPackage | Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion, Publisher, InstallDate | Format-Table -AutoSize`

# Challenges
I had problems to fully use the API https://cve.circl.lu/api/.
Although they documented support of searching by name it did not work for me.
So I search for each program the CVES on https://cve.mitre.org and scrap the HTML data.
Then I got detailed JSON information about the CVE from the Circl API.

Even when I got the information from the Circl API, I had to validate the full name and the full version of the Installed program appear in the current CVE. Which is sometimes a problem because some program writes their name with 'version' and architecture such as 'amd64' or 'x64' which added unwanted results in Mitre API.

Especially with Windows installations. Usually, the programs are not installed with a nice package manager.
Each installation has a different naming scheme and some have missing versions.
Some naming schemas include architecture and version in the name of the program.

Lastly, on Windows, I had to use multiple API to get just a partial list of Windows installed programs. I did try WMIC, but it never finished running and seems as a bottle-neck to this project.
